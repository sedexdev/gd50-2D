Current collision config

1. Entity class has an AABB collides function inherited by:
    - Player
    - Snail
2. GameObject class has an AABB collides function
3. Player class has the following collision functions:
    - checkLeftCollisions
    - checkRightCollisions
    - checkObjectCollisions
4. Tilemap class has the pointToTile function to get Tiles objects
5. Tile class has the collidable function to return boolean if this Tile is collidable

-- These checks are made in the Player State classes --

Check for TileMap collisions
    - get the 2 Tiles objects the Player could be colliding with
        - uses the function TileMap:pointToTile
    - check if Tile object is not empty space and Tile:collidable returns true
    - that's enough to determin collision

Check for Entity (Snail) and GameObject collisions
    - use AABB like in previous game examples

Snail objects do the same TileMap:pointToTile check and change direction if they collide
